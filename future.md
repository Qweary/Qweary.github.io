# Future Research


Ongoing and upcoming investigations include:


- Typical alarm system contacts and their vulnerabilities: How large of an electromagnet would be necessary for the magnetic field to penetrate through various doors/walls?
- Wireless locks: can communication be intercepted between a lock and a proprietary wireless hub?
- Music generation through interactive visual art: can I revive a > decades old senior design project to convert pictures into music? What if users could interact with the picture?
