# 🔬 Current Focus 🔬

This section highlights the research I’m actively working on.  
It will grow as new posts are released, giving a rolling log of progress, challenges, and breakthroughs.

## 👻 Apparition Delivery System (ADS) Research

### **Focus:** Exploring advanced NTFS Alternate Data Stream persistence and modular C2-agnostic payload delivery.

### **What I'm Doing Now:**
- Building a **modular framework** for storing and executing encrypted payloads in ADS
- Testing **LOLBAS execution chains** via VBScript and PowerShell loaders
- Investigating **novel persistence techniques**: volume root ADS, NTFS metadata streams
- Crafting **red team operational workflows** while considering detection and evasion
- Preparing **next-level stealth** experiments on stream naming and recovery mechanisms

### **Goal:** Demonstrate resilient, multi-method persistence that is **C2-framework agnostic**, while documenting blue team detection guidance and real-world limitations.

> _This work is in progress — stay tuned for practical demonstrations, tutorials, and the next wave of stealthy ADS techniques._

## 🎙️ AudioHax: Image → Music → Data  

Fifteen years ago, *Acoustic Art* was a student project with the audacious goal of translating images into music. Today, it has evolved into **AudioHax** — a fusion of art, theory, and security research.  

The new vision:  
- Use computer vision to analyze images (or live video).  
- Map features into structured music.  
- Encode and transmit data over audio channels.  

This is both an artistic installation project *and* an exploration of covert communication channels.
