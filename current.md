# 🔬 Current Focus: T2/T3 Lock System Deep Dive 🔬


This research project began with a deceptively simple question: What assumptions are being made about the security of the devices we physically trust every day?


The DL-Windows system, the CP210x bridge, and the embedded lock firmware all present a fascinating challenge: a blend of old-school protocol behavior, misunderstood trust boundaries, and under-scrutinized deployments.


We're emulating hardware, deconstructing USB conversations, and replicating interactions from scratch using custom tools. Why? Because real-world lock infrastructure shouldn't be a black box.


Full write-up, tools, and proof-of-concept videos coming soon.
