# 🧭 About Me 🧭


I'm a security professional operating at the intersection of physical and cyber systems, with a specialization in vulnerability research, embedded systems, and protocol-level analysis. My work blends engineering discipline with a red-team mindset: find the weak points, understand how they break, and—when possible—show how they can be fixed.


Over the years, I've developed and deconstructed systems ranging from consumer IoT to critical infrastructure components. My focus is not just on exploitability, but on trust boundaries—what people assume a system will do, and what it actually does under pressure.


This blog documents deep dives, real-world case studies, and occasionally the dead ends—because in this field, failure teaches too. All testing is conducted under proper authorization and legal clearance.
