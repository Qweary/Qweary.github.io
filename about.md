# 🧭 About Me 🧭


I’ve spent the last few years breaking into things I’m explicitly allowed to — from malfunctioning vault locks to embedded systems with forgotten debug ports. Most of my work sits at the intersection of physical and digital access: firmware, bypasses, trust boundaries, and the messy assumptions in between.

This blog is where I dig into security research — often in the form of hardware hacking, system analysis, or the occasional off-the-wall idea that deserves a deeper look.

I believe physical, digital, and social engineering should be viewed as parts of a single threat model. This is my space to explore that philosophy, share research, and occasionally cause good trouble.

Not everything here is production-ready — but the goal is always impact, not polish.
