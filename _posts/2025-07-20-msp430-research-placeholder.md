This placeholder outlines upcoming documentation related to MSP430 reverse engineering — especially memory-mapped NAND flash manipulation, firmware patching, and investigation into low-level write mechanics.


Topics to be included:
- Write redirection and function hooking
- Preserving execution context across patched code
- NAND flash structure and behavior
- Testing methodology and failure modes


More details to follow soon.
