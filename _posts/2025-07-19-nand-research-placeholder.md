summary: "Placeholder post to outline and organize research logs involving NAND manipulation and memory-mapped I/O debugging."
---


This placeholder outlines upcoming documentation related to NAND reverse engineering â€” specifically the user data stored in the non-volatile memory of a T3 lock. We will also cover code injection and audit tampering.


Topics to be included:
- Where is user data stored in a lock
- NAND flash structure and behavior
- Testing methodology and failure modes
- How to inject a user code and obfuscate your tracks


More details to follow soon.
