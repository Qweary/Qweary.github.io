This post will document USB device emulation efforts centered on replicating the CP2102 bridge using FaceDancer and Python.


Planned content includes:
- USB descriptor crafting
- Vendor request handling (with PCAP-derived values)
- Loopback testing under DL-Windows
- Reverse-engineering Windows driver behavior


Full technical analysis coming soon.
