# Future Research


Ongoing and upcoming investigations include:


- Emulating CP210x USB-UART bridge devices to intercept and replay proprietary software interactions.
- Analyzing NAND flash command sequences across embedded access control platforms.
- Publishing in Phrack-style formats to document full methodology for reverse engineering hardware/software co-design.
- Exploratory tooling: developing open-source USB emulation frameworks compatible with modern OS stacks.
