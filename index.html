    <h1>ðŸ”“ Research With Purpose</h1>
    <p>
      I explore the intersection of physical and digital security through hands-on, authorized vulnerability research. My goal isn't to exploit systems for shock value, but to expose assumptions and inspire stronger designs through informed analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it's reverse engineering embedded memory, emulating hardware protocols, or replaying real-world attacks under controlled conditions, this site documents real findings, real tools, and real-world impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is research with permission, with perspective, and with purpose.

    <h2>ðŸ§  About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a security professional operating at the intersection of physical and cyber systems, with a specialization in vulnerability research, embedded systems, and protocol-level analysis. My work blends engineering discipline with a red-team mindset: find the weak points, understand how they break, andâ€”when possibleâ€”show how they can be fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've developed and deconstructed systems ranging from consumer IoT to critical infrastructure components. My focus is not just on exploitability, but on <em>trust boundaries</em>â€”what people assume a system will do, and what it <strong>actually</strong> does under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog documents deep dives, real-world case studies, and occasionally the dead endsâ€”because in this field, failure teaches too. All testing is conducted under proper authorization and legal clearance.

  <section id="t2t3">
    <h2>ðŸ”¬ Current Focus: T2/T3 Lock System Deep Dive</h2>
    <p>
      This research project began with a deceptively simple question: What assumptions are being made about the security of the devices we physically trust every day?
    </p>
    <p>
      The DL-Windows system, the CP210x bridge, and the embedded lock firmware all present a fascinating challenge: a blend of old-school protocol behavior, misunderstood trust boundaries, and under-scrutinized deployments.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're emulating hardware, deconstructing USB conversations, and replicating interactions from scratch using custom tools. Why? Because real-world lock infrastructure shouldn't be a black box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full write-up, tools, and proof-of-concept videos coming soon.

    <h3>âœ… [T2/T3] Control Transfer Emulation Passes Vendor Request Stage</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 12, 2025</p>
    <p>After replicating the CP210x descriptor set and stubbing control requests, the emulated device now responds to request 0xFF with the expected 0x02 replyâ€”mirroring the real cable. This moved us past packet 23 in the DL-Windows loopback sequence. Next: bulk IN endpoint behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 10, 2025</p>
    <p>Despite correct setup and enumeration, the emulated device doesn't reply to the bulk IN request at packet 42. Attempted multiple endpoint configurations and timing tweaks. Suspecting software expects specific loopback timing or echo content...</p>
