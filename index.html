      <h2>📌 Why This Research Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The decision to dive into this particular system wasn’t random—it was personal, professional, and overdue.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a security professional straddling both physical and cyber domains, I’ve spent years watching the lines blur between what’s tangible and what’s digital. The lock in your hand now has firmware. The keypad at your door might have more attack surface than your web server. We’ve accepted convenience without questioning the assumptions behind it. I’m here to question them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specific product caught my attention not because it was the most vulnerable, but because it’s the most <strong>common</strong>. It’s trusted. It's deployed widely across institutions, businesses, and facilities that assume “secure” means “invisible to attack.”
      </p>
      <p>
        But no system should be above scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is not destruction—it’s illumination. Through methodical, transparent research, I intend to surface the design decisions, implementation flaws, and trust assumptions embedded in the systems we rely on. Whether you're a fellow researcher, a developer, or a decision-maker, I hope this work sparks curiosity, conversation, and ultimately better security.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is research with permission, purpose, and perspective. Let’s get to work.

      <h2>🧠 About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a security professional operating at the intersection of physical and cyber systems, with a specialization in vulnerability research, embedded systems, and protocol-level analysis. My work blends engineering discipline with a red-team mindset: find the weak points, understand how they break, and—when possible—show how they can be fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I've developed and deconstructed systems ranging from consumer IoT to critical infrastructure components. My focus is not just on exploitability, but on <em>trust boundaries</em>—what people assume a system will do, and what it <strong>actually</strong> does under pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog documents deep dives, real-world case studies, and occasionally the dead ends—because in this field, failure teaches too. All testing is conducted under proper authorization and legal clearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're here to learn, collaborate, or challenge assumptions: welcome.
